# What is Create React App? 
### It's a tool that React developers made to build a simple React project with tools and configurations to start engineers off. 

# Let's make our own! 

1) open your terminal 
2) type the following: <br/>
    - cd ~ (this is to go into your home directory)
    - cd Documents (let's make a project folder in here)
    - mkdir learn-react
    - ls (you should be able to see your new project: learn react)
    - cd learn-react (we have to go into our project to use it)
    - npx create-react-app react-project-1 (react-project-1 can be anything, you just can't have empty spaces)
